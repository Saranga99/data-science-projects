how are you doing today
I have been having trouble breathing lately 
have you had any type of cold lately 
no I haven't had a cold I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe 
do you have any allergies that you know of 
no I don't have any allergies that I know of 
does this happen on time or mostly when you were active 
it happens a lot when I work out
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma 
thank you for your help doctor
