      "my eyes a man who clearly considered his experience and his skill\n",
      "in expounding philosophical principles as the smallest of his merits;\n",

      "From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family\n",

      "to nature; and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully\n",
      "after the interests of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons,\n",
      "and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the power\n",
      "of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with\n",
      "him was more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he\n",
      "was most highly venerated by those who associated with him: and he\n",
      "had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent\n",
      "and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and he never\n",
      "showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from passion,\n",
      "and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without\n",
      "noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and\n",
      "not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous\n",
      "or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce\n",
      "the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way\n",

      "thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion.\n",

      "\n",
      "From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity\n",

      "\n",
      "From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even\n",

      "to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers,\n",
      "as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children\n",
      "truly. \n",
      "\n",
      "From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to\n",
      "love justice; and through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvidius,\n",
      "Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in\n",
      "which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard\n",
      "to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly\n",
      "government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed;\n",
      "I learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in\n",
      "my regard for philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give\n",
      "to others readily, and to cherish good hopes, and to believe that\n",
      "I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment of\n",
      "his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, and that his\n",
      "friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish,\n",
      "but it was quite plain. \n",
      "\n",
      "From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by\n",
      "anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness;\n",
      "and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity,\n",
      "and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that\n",
      "everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that\n",
      "he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement\n",
      "and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a\n",
      "thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise\n",
      "his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious.\n",
      "He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive,\n",
      "and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of\n",
      "a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who\n",
      "had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that\n",
      "he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better\n",
      "man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution\n",
      "in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and\n",
      "no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of\n",
      "labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had\n",
      "anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness\n",
      "in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived\n",
      "from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission.\n",
      "And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered\n",
      "himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends\n",
      "from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity\n",
      "when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by\n",
      "reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed\n",
      "too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and\n",
      "his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through\n",
      "being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and\n",
      "that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired\n",
      "of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied\n",
      "on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off,\n",
      "and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately\n",
      "popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the\n",
      "things which were necessary for the administration of the empire,\n",
      "and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure\n",
      "the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious\n",
      "with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying\n",
      "to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety\n",
      "in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action,\n",
      "nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the\n",
      "commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply,\n",
      "he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when\n",
      "he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had\n",
      "them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that\n",
      "he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant;\n",
      "but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery,\n",
      "able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured\n",
      "those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who\n",
      "pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He\n",
      "was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without\n",
      "any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's\n",
      "health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard\n",
      "to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through\n",
      "his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's\n",
      "art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to\n",
      "give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty,\n",
      "such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or\n",
      "of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy\n",
      "reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably\n",
      "to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation\n",
      "of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but\n",
      "he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the\n",
      "same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately\n",
      "fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not\n",
      "but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and\n",
      "he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles\n",
      "and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people,\n",
      "and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be\n",
      "done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not\n",
      "take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses,\n",
      "nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of\n",
      "his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from\n",
      "Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know\n",
      "how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon;\n",
      "and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor\n",
      "implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to\n",
      "the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he\n",
      "had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously\n",
      "and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded\n",
      "of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy,\n",
      "those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy\n",
      "without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to\n",
      "be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible\n",
      "soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus. \n",
      "\n",
      "To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents,\n",
      "a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends,\n",
      "nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not\n",
      "hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition\n",
      "which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something\n",
      "of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence\n",
      "of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to\n",
      "the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine,\n",
      "and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make\n",
      "proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the\n",
      "time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to\n",
      "take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that\n",
      "it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either\n",
      "guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like\n",
      "show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near\n",
      "to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason\n",
      "either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to\n",
      "the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner\n",
      "that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother,\n",
      "who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over\n",
      "myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection;\n",
      "that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I\n",
      "did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies,\n",
      "in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen\n",
      "that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those\n",
      "who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire,\n",
      "without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after,\n",
      "because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus,\n",

      "according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so\n",
      "far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations,\n",
      "nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though\n",
      "I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing\n",
      "the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions;\n",
      "that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never\n",
      "touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen\n",
      "into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of\n",
      "humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion\n",
      "to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she\n",
      "spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished\n",
      "to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never\n",
      "told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the\n",
      "same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that\n",
      "I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple;\n",
      "that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies\n",
      "have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting\n",
      "and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy,\n",
      "I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste\n",
      "my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms,\n",

       " \"In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution\\nin the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and\\nno vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of\\nlabour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had\\nanything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness\\nin giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived\\nfrom experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission.\\nAnd I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered\\nhimself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends\\nfrom all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity\\nwhen he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by\\nreason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed\\ntoo his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and\\nhis persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through\\nbeing satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and\\nthat his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired\\nof them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied\\non all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off,\\nand to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately\\npopular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the\\nthings which were necessary for the administration of the empire,\\nand to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure\\nthe blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious\\nwith respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying\\nto please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety\\nin all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action,\\nnor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the\\ncommodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply,\\nhe used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when\\nhe had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had\\nthem not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that\\nhe was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant;\\nbut every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery,\\nable to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured\\nthose who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who\\npretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He\\nwas also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without\\nany offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's\\nhealth, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard\\nto personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through\\nhis own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's\\nart or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to\\ngive way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty,\\nsuch as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or\\nof anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy\\nreputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably\\nto the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation\\nof doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but\\nhe loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the\\nsame things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately\\nfresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not\\nbut very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and\\nhe showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles\\nand the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people,\\nand in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be\\ndone, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not\\ntake the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses,\\nnor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of\\nhis clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from\\nLorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know\\nhow he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon;\\nand such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor\\nimplacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to\\nthe sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he\\nhad abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously\\nand consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded\\nof Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy,\\nthose things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy\\nwithout excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to\\nbe sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible\\nsoul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus. \",\n",

He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved.

And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus. \",\n",

Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.\",\n",

Rightly then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the offence which is committed with pleasure is more blameable than that which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more like a person who has been first wronged and through pain is compelled to be angry; but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being carried towards doing something by desire.

But in truth they do exist, and they do care for human things, and they have put all the means in man's power to enable him not to fall into real evils.

Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse?

But death certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.\",\n",

To observe too who these are whose opinions and voices give reputation; what death is, and the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by the abstractive power of reflection resolves into their parts all the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will then consider it to be nothing else than an operation of nature; and if any one is afraid of an operation of nature, he is a child. This, however, is not only an operation of nature, but it is also a thing which conduces to the purposes of nature.

For the things from the gods merit veneration for their excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by reason of men's ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not less than that which deprives us of the power of distinguishing things that are white and black. \",\n",

In the third place, the soul does violence to itself when it is overpowered by pleasure or by pain. Fourthly, when it plays a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. Fifthly, when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with reference to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity.

For if he shall begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite, and whatever else there is of the kind, will not fail; but the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating all appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from life, and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason, all this is already extinguished.

And again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works. \",\n",

For two reasons then it is right to be content with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for thee and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and the other, because even that which comes severally to every man is to the power which administers the universe a cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very continuance.

For since the universal nature has made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for the universal nature is the nature of things that are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come into existence. And further, this universal nature is named truth, and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth, for he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with the universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things which cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the things towards which the universal nature is equally affected- for it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards both- towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and equally affected. With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously. And I say that the universal nature employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come after them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence, according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of things, having conceived certain principles of the things which were to be, and having determined powers productive of beings and of changes and of such like successions.

This, then, is consistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be neither careless nor impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death, but to wait for it as one of the operations of nature.

Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here, that even every substance which is somewhat dry, is easily ignited, because there is less mingled with it of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then everything also which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like manner towards that which is of the same kind with itself, or moves even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and the nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals there are souls, and that power which brings them together is seen to exert itself in the superior degree, and in such a way as never has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational animals there are political communities and friendships, and families and meetings of people; and in wars, treaties and armistices. But in the things which are still superior, even though they are separated from one another, unity in a manner exists, as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even in things which are separated. See, then, what now takes place. For only intelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and inclination, and in them alone the property of flowing together is not seen. But still though men strive to avoid this union, they are caught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and thou wilt see what I say, if thou only observest.

For thou wilt find that no one among those against whom thou art irritated has done anything by which thy mind could be made worse; but that which is evil to thee and harmful has its foundation only in the mind. And what harm is done or what is there strange, if the man who has not been instructed does the acts of an uninstructed man? Consider whether thou shouldst not rather blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man to err in such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and yet thou hast forgotten and art amazed that he has erred. But most of all when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to thyself. For the fault is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when conferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it absolutely, nor yet in such way as to have received from thy very act all the profit. For what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service? Art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye demanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. For as these members are formed for a particular purpose, and by working according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own; so also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he has done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the common interest, he has acted conformably to his constitution, and he gets what is his own. \",\n",

Both these suppositions, indeed, are incredible. But if a man should even drop the term Nature (as an efficient power), and should speak of these things as natural, even then it would be ridiculous to affirm at the same time that the parts of the whole are in their nature subject to change, and at the same time to be surprised or vexed as if something were happening contrary to nature, particularly as the dissolution of things is into those things of which each thing is composed. For there is either a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded, or a change from the solid to the earthy and from the airy to the aerial, so that these parts are taken back into the universal reason, whether this at certain periods is consumed by fire or renewed by eternal changes. And do not imagine that the solid and the airy part belong to thee from the time of generation.

I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.',\n",
       " \"In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus.\",\n",

Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.\",\n",

For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the offence which is committed with pleasure is more blameable than that which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more like a person who has been first wronged and through pain is compelled to be angry; but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being carried towards doing something by desire.',\n",

But in truth they do exist, and they do care for human things, and they have put all the means in man's power to enable him not to fall into real evils. And as to the rest, if there was anything evil, they would have provided for this also, that it should be altogether in a man's power not to fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But neither through ignorance, nor having the knowledge, but not the power to guard against or correct these things, is it possible that the nature of the universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible that it has made so great a mistake, either through want of power or want of skill, that good and evil should happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad.

And again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.\",\n",

For in the first case Prescribed means something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted to procure health; and in the second case it means: That which happens to (or, suits) every man is fixed in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. For this is what we mean when we say that things are suitable to us, as the workmen say of squared stones in walls or the pyramids, that they are suitable, when they fit them to one another in some kind of connexion. For there is altogether one fitness, harmony. And as the universe is made up out of all bodies to be such a body as it is, so out of all existing causes necessity (destiny) is made up to be such a cause as it is. And even those who are completely ignorant understand what I mean, for they say, It (necessity, destiny) brought this to such a person.- This then was brought and this was precribed to him. Let us then receive these things, as well as those which Aesculapius prescribes. Many as a matter of course even among his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope of health. Let the perfecting and accomplishment of the things, which the common nature judges to be good, be judged by thee to be of the same kind as thy health. And so accept everything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the health of the universe and to the prosperity and felicity of Zeus (the universe). For he would not have brought on any man what he has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. Neither does the nature of anything, whatever it may be, cause anything which is not suitable to that which is directed by it. For two reasons then it is right to be content with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for thee and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and the other, because even that which comes severally to every man is to the power which administers the universe a cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very continuance. For the integrity of the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything whatever from the conjunction and the continuity either of the parts or of the causes.

For since the universal nature has made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for the universal nature is the nature of things that are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come into existence. And further, this universal nature is named truth, and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth, for he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with the universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things which cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the things towards which the universal nature is equally affected- for it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards both- towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and equally affected. With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously. And I say that the universal nature employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come after them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence, according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of things, having conceived certain principles of the things which were to be, and having determined powers productive of beings and of changes and of such like successions.',\n",

Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here, that even every substance which is somewhat dry, is easily ignited, because there is less mingled with it of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then everything also which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like manner towards that which is of the same kind with itself, or moves even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and the nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals there are souls, and that power which brings them together is seen to exert itself in the superior degree, and in such a way as never has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational animals there are political communities and friendships, and families and meetings of people; and in wars, treaties and armistices. But in the things which are still superior, even though they are separated from one another, unity in a manner exists, as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even in things which are separated. See, then, what now takes place. For only intelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and inclination, and in them alone the property of flowing together is not seen. But still though men strive to avoid this union, they are caught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and thou wilt see what I say, if thou only observest.

Therefore if thou shalt separate from thyself, that is, from thy understanding, whatever others do or say, and whatever thou hast done or said thyself, and whatever future things trouble thee because they may happen, and whatever in the body which envelops thee or in the breath (life), which is by nature associated with the body, is attached to thee independent of thy will, and whatever the external circumfluent vortex whirls round, so that the intellectual power exempt from the things of fate can live pure and free by itself, doing what is just and accepting what happens and saying the truth: if thou wilt separate, I say, from this ruling faculty the things which are attached to it by the impressions of sense, and the things of time to come and of time that is past, and wilt make thyself like Empedocles' sphere,\",\n",
       " 'All round, and in its joyous rest reposing; and if thou shalt strive to live only what is really thy life, that is, the present- then thou wilt be able to pass that portion of life which remains for thee up to the time of thy death, free from perturbations, nobly, and obedient to thy own daemon (to the god that is within thee).',\n",
       " 'I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others. If then a god or a wise teacher should present himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing and to design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived it, he could not endure it even for a single day. So much more respect have we to what our neighbours shall think of us than to what we shall think of ourselves.',\n",
       " 'How can it be that the gods after having arranged all things well and benevolently for mankind, have overlooked this alone, that some men and very good men, and men who, as we may say, have had most communion with the divinity, and through pious acts and religious observances have been most intimate with the divinity, when they have once died should never exist again, but should be completely extinguished?',\n",
       " 'But if this is so, be assured that if it ought to have been otherwise, the gods would have done it. For if it were just, it would also be possible; and if it were according to nature, nature would have had it so. But because it is not so, if in fact it is not so, be thou convinced that it ought not to have been so:- for thou seest even of thyself that in this inquiry thou art disputing with the diety; and we should not thus dispute with the gods, unless they were most excellent and most just;- but if this is so, they would not have allowed anything in the ordering of the universe to be neglected unjustly and irrationally.',\n",
       " 'Practise thyself even in the things which thou despairest of accomplishing. For even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things for want of practice, holds the bridle more vigorously than the right hand; for it has been practised in this.',\n",
       " 'Consider in what condition both in body and soul a man should be when he is overtaken by death; and consider the shortness of life, the boundless abyss of time past and future, the feebleness of all matter.',\n",
       " 'Contemplate the formative principles (forms) of things bare of their coverings; the purposes of actions; consider what pain is, what pleasure is, and death, and fame; who is to himself the cause of his uneasiness; how no man is hindered by another; that everything is opinion.',\n",
       " 'In the application of thy principles thou must be like the pancratiast, not like the gladiator; for the gladiator lets fall the sword which he uses and is killed; but the other always has his hand, and needs to do nothing else than use it.',\n",

       " 'What a power man has to do nothing except what God will approve, and to accept all that God may give him.',\n",
       " 'With respect to that which happens conformably to nature, we ought to blame neither gods, for they do nothing wrong either voluntarily or involuntarily, nor men, for they do nothing wrong except involuntarily. Consequently we should blame nobody.',\n",

       " 'Either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind Providence, or a confusion without a purpose and without a director (Book IV). If then there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou resist? But if there is a Providence which allows itself to be propitiated, make thyself worthy of the help of the divinity. But if there is a confusion without governor, be content that in such a tempest thou hast in thyself a certain ruling intelligence. And even if the tempest carry thee away, let it carry away the poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else; for the intelligence at least it will not carry away.',\n",

       " \"When a man has presented the appearance of having done wrong, say, How then do I know if this is a wrongful act? And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself? and so this is like tearing his own face. Consider that he, who would not have the bad man do wrong, is like the man who would not have the fig-tree to bear juice in the figs and infants to cry and the horse to neigh, and whatever else must of necessity be. For what must a man do who has such a character? If then thou art irritable, cure this man's disposition.\",\n",

       " 'Consider that before long thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor will any of the things exist which thou now seest, nor any of those who are now living. For all things are formed by nature to change and be turned and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession may exist.',\n",
       " 'Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power. Take away then, when thou choosest, thy opinion, and like a mariner, who has doubled the promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable, and a waveless bay.',\n",
       " 'Any one activity whatever it may be, when it has ceased at its proper time, suffers no evil because it has ceased; nor he who has done this act, does he suffer any evil for this reason that the act has ceased. In like manner then the whole which consists of all the acts, which is our life, if it cease at its proper time, suffers no evil for this reason that it has ceased; nor he who has terminated this series at the proper time, has he been ill dealt with. But the proper time and the limit nature fixes, sometimes as in old age the peculiar nature of man, but always the universal nature, by the change of whose parts the whole universe continues ever young and perfect. And everything which is useful to the universal is always good and in season. Therefore the termination of life for every man is no evil, because neither is it shameful, since it is both independent of the will and not opposed to the general interest, but it is good, since it is seasonable and profitable to and congruent with the universal. For thus too he is moved by the deity who is moved in the same manner with the deity and moved towards the same things in his mind.',\n",
       " 'These three principles thou must have in readiness. In the things which thou doest do nothing either inconsiderately or otherwise than as justice herself would act; but with respect to what may happen to thee from without, consider that it happens either by chance or according to Providence, and thou must neither blame chance nor accuse Providence. Second, consider what every being is from the seed to the time of its receiving a soul, and from the reception of a soul to the giving back of the same, and of what things every being is compounded and into what things it is resolved. Third, if thou shouldst suddenly be raised up above the earth, and shouldst look down on human things, and observe the variety of them how great it is, and at the same time also shouldst see at a glance how great is the number of beings who dwell around in the air and the aether, consider that as often as thou shouldst be raised up, thou wouldst see the same things, sameness of form and shortness of duration. Are these things to be proud of?',\n",

And thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's intelligence is a god, and is an efflux of the deity; and forgotten this, that nothing is a man's own, but that his child and his body and his very soul came from the deity; forgotten this, that everything is opinion; and lastly thou hast forgotten that every man lives the present time only, and loses only this.\",\n",

Smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale. And let there be present to thy mind also everything of this sort, how Fabius Catullinus lived in the country, and Lucius Lupus in his gardens, and Stertinius at Baiae, and Tiberius at Capreae and Velius Rufus (or Rufus at Velia); and in fine think of the eager pursuit of anything conjoined with pride; and how worthless everything is after which men violently strain; and how much more philosophical it is for a man in the opportunities presented to him to show']"
