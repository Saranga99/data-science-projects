If your child is not comfortable, make the bathroom \\na fun place! You can do this is many a ways, either read a book with your child in \\nthe bathroom with them, play their favorite music and have a dance party with \\nthem, etc. Also, before starting it is very helpful to make sure that your child is \\nconstantly drinking fluids, as that will ensure that there is more times for you and \\nyour child to practice using the toilet appropriately. Another helpful thing to use, \\nis a chart to show your childâ€™s progress. You can include the date, time, accidents, \\nsuccessful uses of the toilet, and successful initiations by your child.  \\nOnce your child is comfortable, then itâ€™s time to set up a routine. Toilet training \\ntakes time and patience. Set a kitchen timer at regular intervals, anywhere from \\n10-20 minutes. When the timer goes off, show your child either a photograph of \\nthe toilet or take them to the toilet and say, â€œI need to go pottyâ€, or something \\nalong those lines. If your child is nonverbal, have a picture of a toilet and say \\nâ€œpottyâ€ while pointing at the photo. This helps your child hear the correct words \\nthat will let you know that they need to go to the bathroom. \\nThen, sit your child on the toilet for a few minutes, if your child does use the \\ntoilet, give them verbal praise and a special treat that is reserved for potty time \\nonly. Like a cookie, marshmallow, or a cool sticker on their potty chart. If your \\nchild does not use the toilet, just pull up your childâ€™s underwear, and resume \\nwhatever you were doing before, with a new timer set. \\nOnce your child is accident free for 2-3 days, increase the interval 5-10 minutes. \\nFrom there, you can increase the interval ever 2-3 days until they are on schedule \\nof every hour, or they are using the toilet correctly by telling you that they need \\nthe restroom. Once your child is at the hour interval, stop bringing them to the \\ntoilet. They should be able to correctly ask, but if you notice theyâ€™re not asking \\nand you see your child showing signs of having to go to the bathroom, stop \\nreinforcing them using the toilet, instead reinforce them asking for it by bringing \\nthem either towards the bathroom, or showing them the picture of the toilet. \\nWhen your child sees the reminder and says â€œI need to go pottyâ€, give immediate \\npraise and possible small treat for them telling you that need to go. If you decided \\nto use the chart to help you and your child track the progress, it will also help you \\nsee when it is a good time to raise the intervals. \\nAs youâ€™re going through the intervals, set up a dry pants check. Around halfway \\nthrough the timer, ask your child if their pants are dry. You can teach them how \\nto check their pants with their hand and if it is dry, you can give them praise and \\nreinforce the toilet training by saying â€œGood job! We potty in the toilet!â€ if your \\nchild does have an accident, try and keep it positive. â€œGood try, you almost made \\nit!â€ and take your child to the toilet while reminding them where they use the ', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6614113472656696, 'meta': {'name': '0_Toilet_Training_issues_1.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '234a498e94bb7349cc2c490cd1332c7b'}>,\n",

One reason could be that the\\nchild wasnâ€™t actually toilet trained. A toilet trained child would be one that should\\nwant to use the toilet, if your child is having an accident every day, you might\\nneed to start the whole process of toilet training over again.\\nAnother reason could be stress, or they get distracted easily. If it is stress, either\\nfrom a new routine, a new school, or a new sibling, once your child gets into the\\nnew routine, they should fall right back into their training. If they are getting\\ndistracted easily, they might not notice when they have to use the restroom. Go\\nback to the toilet training of using a timer with a set interval, and having your\\nchild sit on the toilet for a certain time period. If they correctly use it, give them\\nverbal praise. If they donâ€™t, stay positive with them and say something along the\\nlines of â€œthatâ€™s okay! We can try again later.â€ And go back to whatever you were\\ndoing before the timer went off, and repeat with each interval.\\nAnother reason could be health issues.
