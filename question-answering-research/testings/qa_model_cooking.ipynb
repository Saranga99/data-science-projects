So its still perfectly normal for a child to wet the\\nbed up until the age of 7. It is often just a stage in their development. And while\\ngirls can and do wet the bed, it is 2 times for likely for a boy to wet the bed.\\nThere are a few things that can cause bedwetting. Dr. Charles Kwon is a pediatric\\nnephrologist, says that the underlying issue is usually a bladder thatâ€™s not\\nmatured yet. Other possible causes can be a hormone imbalance, constipation,\\nthe child is having a lot of stress and anxiety, they have ADHD, they have a small\\nbladder, or there is a family history of childhood bedwetting. Bed wetting in some\\ncases could also be a sign of sleep apnea if your child snores a lot or shows other\\nsigns of sleep apnea, a UTI (urinary tract infections), or even diabetes. Talking\\nwith your childs doctor is always suggested, just in case.\\nThere are a few suggestions on how to stop bedwetting from doctors. You can\\nshift times for drinking, have your child increase their liquid intake earlier in the\\nday and after dinner, stop their fluid intake. Another thing you can do is schedule\\nbathroom breaks for your child, ever few hours, and then again right before\\nbedtime. Also, always be encouraging and positive, constantly reward their\\nsuccess and donâ€™t be negative. Instead getting angry that they wet the bed again,\\nsay something along the lines of â€œthatâ€™s okay, weâ€™ll just have more potty breaks\\ntoday and try again tonight.â€ Never punish them for wetting the bed. You also\\ndonâ€™t want to wake up your child to urinate, because that will only lead to more\\nsleeplessness and frustration for you and your child.\\nSometimes, an earlier bedtime is the answer. Often, a child is a deep sleeper\\nbecause they just arenâ€™t getting enough sleep. Another suggestion is eliminate\\nbladder irritants such as caffeine (chocolate milk and coco), and if that doesnâ€™t\\nwork, cut out citrus juices, artificial flavorings, dyes, and sweeteners as those can\\nall irritate bladders. Try and avoid thirst overload, one way you can do this by\\nseeing if your childâ€™s school allows them water bottles that way they can drink\\nthroughout the day and avoid gulping down water after school. They also have a\\ndevice that you can clip onto your childâ€™s underwear or place on the bed that\\ndetects moisture and the alarm goes off, and pediatric urologist Dr Audrey Rhee,\\nMD, suggest that one might be helpful but only if your child is motivated to stop\\nthe issue. â€œIf theyâ€™re still sneaking drinks late at night and eating what they\\nshouldnâ€™t, then it doesnâ€™t make sense to invest in an expensive bedwetting alarm.\\nSo, I directly ask a child if bedwetting bothers them, to find out if itâ€™s the parentsâ€™\\nfrustration that brought the child to the appointment or their own,â€ Dr. Rhee\\nsays. If there not motivated yet to stop, then possibly as they get older the\\nopportunities to go to slumber parties and weekend trips with family and friends\\ncould likely motivate your child to stop.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6693471940670754, 'meta': {'name': '3_Toilet_Training_issues_4.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ce8b05d655380a32d9b5bd9c71ad8b4e'}>,\n",
      " <Document: {'content': 'Before you start to toilet train, it is important to make sure that your child is \\ncomfortable in the bathroom. If your child is not comfortable, make the bathroom \\na fun place! You can do this is many a ways, either read a book with your child in \\nthe bathroom with them, play their favorite music and have a dance party with \\nthem, etc. Also, before starting it is very helpful to make sure that your child is \\nconstantly drinking fluids, as that will ensure that there is more times for you and \\nyour child to practice using the toilet appropriately. Another helpful thing to use, \\nis a chart to show your childâ€™s progress. You can include the date, time, accidents, \\nsuccessful uses of the toilet, and successful initiations by your child.  \\nOnce your child is comfortable, then itâ€™s time to set up a routine. Toilet training \\ntakes time and patience. Set a kitchen timer at regular intervals, anywhere from \\n10-20 minutes. When the timer goes off, show your child either a photograph of \\nthe toilet or take them to the toilet and say, â€œI need to go pottyâ€, or something \\nalong those lines. If your child is nonverbal, have a picture of a toilet and say \\nâ€œpottyâ€ while pointing at the photo. This helps your child hear the correct words \\nthat will let you know that they need to go to the bathroom. \\nThen, sit your child on the toilet for a few minutes, if your child does use the \\ntoilet, give them verbal praise and a special treat that is reserved for potty time \\nonly. Like a cookie, marshmallow, or a cool sticker on their potty chart. If your \\nchild does not use the toilet, just pull up your childâ€™s underwear, and resume \\nwhatever you were doing before, with a new timer set. \\nOnce your child is accident free for 2-3 days, increase the interval 5-10 minutes. \\nFrom there, you can increase the interval ever 2-3 days until they are on schedule \\nof every hour, or they are using the toilet correctly by telling you that they need \\nthe restroom. Once your child is at the hour interval, stop bringing them to the \\ntoilet. They should be able to correctly ask, but if you notice theyâ€™re not asking \\nand you see your child showing signs of having to go to the bathroom, stop \\nreinforcing them using the toilet, instead reinforce them asking for it by bringing \\nthem either towards the bathroom, or showing them the picture of the toilet. \\nWhen your child sees the reminder and says â€œI need to go pottyâ€, give immediate \\npraise and possible small treat for them telling you that need to go. If you decided \\nto use the chart to help you and your child track the progress, it will also help you \\nsee when it is a good time to raise the intervals. \\nAs youâ€™re going through the intervals, set up a dry pants check. Around halfway \\nthrough the timer, ask your child if their pants are dry. You can teach them how \\nto check their pants with their hand and if it is dry, you can give them praise and \\nreinforce the toilet training by saying â€œGood job!

One reason could be that the\\nchild wasnâ€™t actually toilet trained. A toilet trained child would be one that should\\nwant to use the toilet, if your child is having an accident every day, you might\\nneed to start the whole process of toilet training over again.\\nAnother reason could be stress, or they get distracted easily. If it is stress, either\\nfrom a new routine, a new school, or a new sibling, once your child gets into the\\nnew routine, they should fall right back into their training. If they are getting\\ndistracted easily, they might not notice when they have to use the restroom.

      " <Document: {'content': 'It is perfectly normal for a child to have a rough day, they are tiny humans after\\nall. If it is just one day that they are acting out, it could be because theyâ€™re tired,\\nhungry, or frustrated and they donâ€™t understand how to get out the words for the\\nfeelings that they have inside of them. We arenâ€™t born with a knowledge of how\\nto express our feelings and emotions, and if a child never learns how to identify\\nand resolve the negative emotions, it can cause a pattern of behaviors that are\\nproblematic and sometimes destructive.\\nFirst, what is acting out? We typically use that term when were describing\\nbehaviors that we think are disruptive to our typically day to day. But we cannot\\nforget that because children donâ€™t typically know how to express themselves, they\\nuse acting out as a way to communicate their thoughts and feelings. So essentially\\nchildren act out to reach a goal or have a need met but do so without even\\nWhat to do if your child is not listening? A lot of times, people jump to conclusion\\nthat theyâ€™re child isnâ€™t listening as they are told to turn off the ipad, or turn off the\\ntv and clean up. But, as Shefali Tsabary Ph.D and author of The Awakened Family\\npoints out, they are often just distracted or having too much fun and cannot pull\\ntheir attention away from what they are doing. One suggestion would to be let\\nthem see the benefit in listening. Kids are told what to do all day long, and no one\\nlikes that. So try offering them choices after showing them the benefit of\\nlistening. For example, â€œhey we canâ€™t have ice cream until the dishes from dinner\\nare washed. We donâ€™t have anything to put them in! So do you want to rinse\\nthem or load them into the dishwasher?â€\\nIf you think that your child is just acting wild, remember what Lise Eliot, Ph.D.,\\nassociate professor of neuroscience at Rosalind Franklin University of\\nMedicine and Science, in North Chicago, Illinois says, that young ki ds have\\nenergy to burn yet lack the ability to inhibit their body. So try to give your\\nchild plenty of time for physically activities and if there isnâ€™t space or its not\\nan appropriate place for them to run around, try and give them a task to do,\\nlike, if theyâ€™re big enough, pushing the shopping cart, or help bagging the\\ngroceries at the grocery store.\\nIf your child is talking back or throwing a tantrum, try not to take it\\npersonally. If they get angry and call you a stupid head, just take a calming\\nbreath and remind them that your family doesnâ€™t use language like that, and\\nthat you can see that they are mad. Suggest taking some time to calm down,\\nthat way you can go back to doing whatever task you where doing in the\\nmoment. Some families use a certain chair and call it their thinking chair, so\\nits not a time out chair. Itâ€™s a chair for your child to go a nd calm down, and\\nthink about why they are feeling that way. A thinking chair, or even just\\nhaving a safe space (example, bedroom) for your child to get out their\\nemotions when theyâ€™re having a tantrum is a great way for them to get their\\nfeelings and emotions out. Remember, they donâ€™t have the capability to\\nexpress themselves verbally, so let them get their emotions out, and let\\nthem know they can come and talk to you after and receive advice, hugs, a\\nkiss, whatever they need, after they are done.

Picky eating is a relatively recent theoretical concept and while there is increasing concern within public health over the lack of diversity in some children's diets, adult picky eaters remain an under researched group. This paper reports on the findings of a qualitative study on the routine food choices and practices of 26 families in Sandwell, West Midlands, UK. Photo elicitation and go-along interview data collection methods were used to capture habitual food related behaviours and served to describe the practices of nine individuals who self identified or were described as picky eaters. A thematic analysis revealed that those with the food related identity of picky eater had very restricted diets and experienced strong emotional and physical reactions to certain foods. For some this could be a distressing and alienating experience that hindered their ability to engage in episodes of social eating. Further research is needed to illuminate the specific practices of adult picky eaters, how this impacts on their lives, and how possible interventions might seek to address the challenges they face.\\nKeywords: Adults; Food practices; Identity; Picky eaters.\\nCopyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There are different ways to help your\\nchild feel like they have some control over their food.\\nOne way to try to help a child that is a picky eater is to set realistic expectations. If\\nyou want them to get used to a new food, it can take up to twelve exposures to\\nthe new food to start to like it. It doesnâ€™t mean that they have to eat twelve\\ntimes, they just have to either see it, help prepare it, or listen to someone talk\\nabout it. They also might just need to smell or touch new foods, to try and get a\\nbetter understanding of it. You can help encourage your child by talking about the\\nfoodâ€™s color, smell, and texture, but donâ€™t discuss with them if it tastes good or\\nAnother way to help your child get over the habit is to give them options that you\\nwant them to eat, and donâ€™t make special meals just for them. They eat what you\\neat, but they can have options. If you donâ€™t want your child eating butter and\\nnoodles for every meal, donâ€™t make it an option. For example, for a snack after\\nschool you can put out apples, grapes, and carrots, and that way even if they\\ndonâ€™t eat the eat one or two of the snacks, theyâ€™re still making a healthy choice\\nand they feel like they have a say in what they eat as well.\\nYou can also have your child be a part of the meal prep, to help give them a sense\\nof control over their food. You can have them pick between two or three veggies\\nfor dinner, have them help set the table, or have them help you pick out groceries\\nat the grocery store. Another great piece of advice is to relax and enjoy\\nmealtimes. Make eating a positive experience, and realize that not every meal is\\ngoing to be a perfect meal, because even the healthiest person alive will have a\\nmeal or two that is not perfectly balanced and that is perfectly fine.\\nA wonderful website that can offer some help is the Mayo Clinic website, the link', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6370011974734392, 'meta': {'name': '5_Picky_Eaters_2.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e18c989ab39948569e22ba55c5f45827'}>]\n"

So its still perfectly normal for a child to wet the\\nbed up until the age of 7. It is often just a stage in their development. And while\\ngirls can and do wet the bed, it is 2 times for likely for a boy to wet the bed.\\nThere are a few things that can cause bedwetting. Dr. Charles Kwon is a pediatric\\nnephrologist, says that the underlying issue is usually a bladder thatâ€™s not\\nmatured yet. Other possible causes can be a hormone imbalance, constipation,\\nthe child is having a lot of stress and anxiety, they have ADHD, they have a small\\nbladder, or there is a family history of childhood bedwetting.

Talking\\nwith your childs doctor is always suggested, just in case.\\nThere are a few suggestions on how to stop bedwetting from doctors. You can\\nshift times for drinking, have your child increase their liquid intake earlier in the\\nday and after dinner, stop their fluid intake. Another thing you can do is schedule\\nbathroom breaks for your child, ever few hours, and then again right before\\nbedtime.

Often, a child is a deep sleeper\\nbecause they just arenâ€™t getting enough sleep.

You can do this is many a ways, either read a book with your child in \\nthe bathroom with them, play their favorite music and have a dance party with \\nthem, etc. Also, before starting it is very helpful to make sure that your child is \\nconstantly drinking fluids, as that will ensure that there is more times for you and \\nyour child to practice using the toilet appropriately. Another helpful thing to use, \\nis a chart to show your childâ€™s progress.

Toilet training \\ntakes time and patience. Set a kitchen timer at regular intervals, anywhere from \\n10-20 minutes. When the timer goes off, show your child either a photograph of \\nthe toilet or take them to the toilet and say, â€œI need to go pottyâ€, or something \\nalong those lines. If your child is nonverbal, have a picture of a toilet and say \\nâ€œpottyâ€ while pointing at the photo.

If your \\nchild does not use the toilet, just pull up your childâ€™s underwear, and resume \\nwhatever you were doing before, with a new timer set. \\nOnce your child is accident free for 2-3 days, increase the interval 5-10 minutes. \\nFrom there, you can increase the interval ever 2-3 days until they are on schedule \\nof every hour, or they are using the toilet correctly by telling you that they need \\nthe restroom.

But, as Shefali Tsabary Ph.D and author of The Awakened Family\\npoints out, they are often just distracted or having too much fun and cannot pull\\ntheir attention away from what they are doing. One suggestion would to be let\\nthem see the benefit in listening. Kids are told what to do all day long, and no one\\nlikes that. So try offering them choices after showing them the benefit of\\nlistening. For example, â€œhey we canâ€™t have ice cream until the dishes from dinner\\nare washed. We donâ€™t have anything to put them in! So do you want to rinse\\nthem or load them into the dishwasher?â€\\nIf you think that your child is just acting wild, remember what Lise Eliot, Ph.D.,\\nassociate professor of neuroscience at Rosalind Franklin University of\\nMedicine and Science, in North Chicago, Illinois says, that young ki ds have\\nenergy to burn yet lack the ability to inhibit their body. So try to give your\\nchild plenty of time for physically activities and if there isnâ€™t space or its not\\nan appropriate place for them to run around, try and give them a task to do,\\nlike, if theyâ€™re big enough, pushing the shopping cart, or help bagging the\\ngroceries at the grocery store.\\nIf your child is talking back or throwing a tantrum, try not to take it\\npersonally. If they get angry and call you a stupid head, just take a calming\\nbreath and remind them that your family doesnâ€™t use language like that, and\\nthat you can see that they are mad. Suggest taking some time to calm down,\\nthat way you can go back to doing whatever task you where doing in the\\nmoment. Some families use a certain chair and call it their thinking chair, so\\nits not a time out chair. Itâ€™s a chair for your child to go a nd calm down, and\\nthink about why they are feeling that way. A thinking chair, or even just\\nhaving a safe space (example, bedroom) for your child to get out their\\nemotions when theyâ€™re having a tantrum is a great way for them to get their\\nfeelings and emotions out. Remember, they donâ€™t have the capability to\\nexpress themselves verbally, so let them get their emotions out, and let\\nthem know they can come and talk to you after and receive advice, hugs, a\\nkiss, whatever they need, after they are done. Compassion will help your\\nchild see that having â€œbadâ€ feelings is okay, and having them separate from\\neveryone while letting them out will help teach them that you shouldnâ€™t act', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6401941708906147, 'meta': {'name': '7_Behavior_1.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2dc9c67d0da7e02d80a58f3c6efda2d1'}>,\n",

There are different ways to help your\\nchild feel like they have some control over their food.\\nOne way to try to help a child that is a picky eater is to set realistic expectations. If\\nyou want them to get used to a new food, it can take up to twelve exposures to\\nthe new food to start to like it. It doesnâ€™t mean that they have to eat twelve\\ntimes, they just have to either see it, help prepare it, or listen to someone talk\\nabout it. They also might just need to smell or touch new foods, to try and get a\\nbetter understanding of it. You can help encourage your child by talking about the\\nfoodâ€™s color, smell, and texture, but donâ€™t discuss with them if it tastes good or\\nAnother way to help your child get over the habit is to give them options that you\\nwant them to eat, and donâ€™t make special meals just for them. They eat what you\\neat, but they can have options. If you donâ€™t want your child eating butter and\\nnoodles for every meal, donâ€™t make it an option. For example, for a snack after\\nschool you can put out apples, grapes, and carrots, and that way even if they\\ndonâ€™t eat the eat one or two of the snacks, theyâ€™re still making a healthy choice\\nand they feel like they have a say in what they eat as well.\\nYou can also have your child be a part of the meal prep, to help give them a sense\\nof control over their food. You can have them pick between two or three veggies\\nfor dinner, have them help set the table, or have them help you pick out groceries\\nat the grocery store. Another great piece of advice is to relax and enjoy\\nmealtimes. Make eating a positive experience, and realize that not every meal is\\ngoing to be a perfect meal, because even the healthiest person alive will have a\\nmeal or two that is not perfectly balanced and that is perfectly fine.\\nA wonderful website that can offer some help is the Mayo Clinic website, the link', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6370062845328879, 'meta': {'name': '5_Picky_Eaters_2.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e18c989ab39948569e22ba55c5f45827'}>,\n",
      "               <Document: {'content': \"Picky eaters are defined as those who consume an inadequate variety of food through rejection of a substantial amount of food stuffs that are both familiar and unfamiliar. Picky eating is a relatively recent theoretical concept and while there is increasing concern within public health over the lack of diversity in some children's diets, adult picky eaters remain an under researched group. This paper reports on the findings of a qualitative study on the routine food choices and practices of 26 families in Sandwell, West Midlands, UK. Photo elicitation and go-along interview data collection methods were used to capture habitual food related behaviours and served to describe the practices of nine individuals who self identified or were described as picky eaters. A thematic analysis revealed that those with the food related identity of picky eater had very restricted diets and experienced strong emotional and physical reactions to certain foods. For some this could be a distressing and alienating experience that hindered their ability to engage in episodes of social eating. Further research is needed to illuminate the specific practices of adult picky eaters, how this impacts on their lives, and how possible interventions might seek to address the challenges they face.\\nKeywords: Adults; Food practices; Identity; Picky eaters.\\nCopyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
